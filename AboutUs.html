  	<center>
  		<p style="color:blue;"><b>This system will cater the needs of the people regarding the problem that they were not able to decide the right hospital for their treatment. It provides them with a platform where they can access the necessary information regarding different hospitals located in their city and the health services available there. It keeps the track of the status of the hospital which is monitored on the basis of the feedback provided by patients who visited the hospital.  The system will be user appropriate, easy to use and have an overall satisfaction.</b></p>

  	<p><b><u>The features of the system are:-</u></b></p>
  	
<ul><b>
  <li>The system will be used to get the information (such as health services) from the hospitals in the city and that data will be provided to the users.</li>
  <li>Patients will be given a chance to give their feedback about the hospital they visited, through our feedback functionality.</li>
  <li>The feedbacks and reviews will be stored to maintain the overall ratings of the hospitals.</li>
  <li>Several systems have been developed but neither of them keeps the track of the status of the hospitals in terms of health services availability and hospitality towards the need of the patients.</li>
  <li>The system will reduce overall time of the patients when they have to decide the right hospital for them.</li>
</b></ul>
